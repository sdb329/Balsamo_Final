                        <p>With 100% snowmaking capabilities, four mountain peaks, eight lifts and 46 trails—ranging in
                            difficulty from Lower Horizon to Wacky Way—Mountain Creek is a great pick for family outdoor
                            fun. In addition to alpine skiing, Mountain Creek offers extra-small to large freestyle parks
                            for snowboarding and one of the area’s largest snow tubing parks. (Parents: Imagine all the fun
                            of sledding without the climb back up the hill!) It’s easy to turn your ski day into a
                            slope-side overnight getaway with The Appalachian's one- and two-bedroom accommodations with
                            kitchens. Check out the resort’s stay packages and get the latest details on their COVID-19

                            attractions in the Skylands. Take a winter hike along the Appalachian Trail at Wawayanda State
                            Park or go snowshoeing at High Point State Park, where you can catch a three-state view from
                            High Point Monument. Or angle for perch and pickerel at Hopatcong State Park, where both Lake
                            Hopatcong and Lake Musconetcong offer excellent ice fishing in the winter months. *Note: The
                            park is currently under a Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB) Watch and consuming fish is not recommended
                            at this time. Please check the website for status updates before going fishing.</p>
